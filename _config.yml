about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am a Senior DevOps Engineer with huge developer experience in past(~6 years). During my career I worked with various programming languages such as PHP, JS and Python but always had a passion to infrastructure and whole picture understanding how applications should work so I passed [GCP associate certification](https://www.credential.net/2d78e3ea-c984-4360-84c7-eefca15d2f25), mastered k8s and switched to the DevOps position. I believe my experience helps me to better cooperate with developers and create suitable infrastructure and automate routine tasks which will give the best possible result for the project. My interests is cryptocurrencies, self-education and drone racing.
